## About
Improved PHP omni-completion. Based on the default phpcomplete.vim.
## Features
 * Correct restriction of static or standard methods based on context ( show only static methods with `::` and only standard with `->`)
 * Real support for `self::` and `$this->` with the aforementioned context restriction
 * Constant variable completion (not just `define(VARIABLE, 1)` but `const VARIABLE = 1`)
 * Better class detection:
	 - Recognize `/* @var $yourvar YourClass */` type mark comments.
	 - Recognize `$instance = new Class;` class instantiations.
	 - Recognize `$instance = Class::getInstance();` singleton instances.
	 - Recognize `$date = DateTime::createFromFormat(...)` built-in class return types.
	 - Recognize type hinting in function prototypes.
 * Updated built-in class support with constants, methods and properties
 * Updated list of PHP constants
 * Updated list of built-in PHP functions

## Options

**let g:phpcomplete\_relax\_static\_constraint = 1/0  [default 0]** <br>
Enables completion for non-static methods when completing for static context (`::`).
This generates `E_STRICT` level warning, but php calls these methods nontheless.
